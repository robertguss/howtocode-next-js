In this article, I will show you step by step how I create screencasts for developers.

> Info: I use a Mac, and so all of the information and software mentioned in this article is going to be specific to Mac.

## Planning

This is probably the most important step in creating any screencast. Before you hit the record button, you need to understand what kind of screencast you are creating. There are several different types of screencasts, and each one has its own unique requirements. The most common types of screencasts that I personally record and will be discussing in this article are:

1. Presentations with Keynote
2. Live Coding

### Presentations with Keynote

These types of screencasts are where I present several prepared slides, usually with code examples and animations, and narrate over them. Here are some examples:

### Live Coding

These types of screencasts are when I record myself live coding. This type of screencast is intended to feel as if you were looking over my shoulder, similar to a pair programming session. Here are some examples:

## Creating the Script

I personally write a script only for the "Presentations with Keynote" types of screencasts. I freeform the "Live Coding" ones as they come off more natural that way, plus it is next to impossible for me to read a script while coding at the same time.

One of the nice things about having a script is that you know exactly what you are going to say, and it is incredibly easy to make adjustments. I find it easier to split the script into multiple sections, recording a video for each one. For Example:

In the video below, I broke the script into nine different sections.

Here is what the script looks like:

Once I have the script complete, I then begin to create the slides.
